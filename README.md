# travis_trial

## This project is just a practise round and familiarise myself with travis, how it works and how to configure it on a project.

#These are the steps you need to follow
## Step 1
Create a repository on github
##Step 2
create a folder using this commmand ```mkdir folder_name```
Add remote
This is the folder that will contain all the work you will be pushing to github, and tested by Travis.
* Inside this folder you need to create a test folder ```mkdir test ```
* and a file ```touch index.js```
* Change into your test folder ```cd test```
* Create a test file ```touch index_test.js``` and write your test here.
* On your ```index.js``` file write your function.

##Step 3
