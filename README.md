# travis_trial

## This project is just a practise round and familiarise myself with travis, how it works and how to configure it on a project.

#These are the steps you need to follow
##Step 1
create a folder using this commmand '''mkdir <folder_name>'''
this is the folder that will contain all the work you will be pushing to github, and tested by Travis.
